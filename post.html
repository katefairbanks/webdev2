                        <p>While not everyone has the time to make elaborate meals, everyone should get to eat delicious meals no matter how much time they have. In my house, we ate dinner together as a family every single day. With everyone’s busy schedules, it was nice to sit down and eat together at the end of the day. What you eat also affects your health and your mood, so it’s important to eat healthy and yummy food.</p>
                        <p>I love being able to make quick meals if I’m rushing out the door, forgot to start dinner earlier, or have hungry little kids about to reach the meltdown stage if they don’t get food. As an older sister with 7 younger siblings, I’ve had to babysit a lot or take care of dinner for the family when my mom was busy.</p>
                        <p>When I was a nanny for my cousins I took over doing meals for my aunt and uncle (they really appreciated it) and I needed an actual meal and not just Carson’s favorite: grilled cheese and sliced apples, or the classic mac ansd cheese from a box, so I learned how to make some of these recipes. I still use them a lot as a college student when making my own meals.</p>
                        <p>Not only do these recipes take less than 10 minutes to put on the table, but they are super simple too. Anyone can make them, no matter their skills in the kitchen. (These recipies are picky-eater approved as well!)</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Broccoli Tortellini</h2>
                        <p>One of my favorite meals to make, the best part is, it's only a few ingredients and they go in the frezer! The rest are everyday baking or cooking ingredients that you alreasdy have on hand.</p>
                        <p>You can easily adjust this recipie to add in extra flavor and make your own version. This recipie works great alongside some rolls or a salad for dinner, or even just by itself for lunch.</p>
